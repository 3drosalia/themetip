# Customize your tooltips!
### A simple mod that allows you to change the appearance of your tooltips!

***After being around in the Modded Minecraft community for a while, I had noticed that there was a lack of mods that allowed the user to change the appearance of their tooltips. There were always mods that added information to the tooltips, or changed the look only for a modpack's brand.***

**This mod allows easy customization of tooltips, within Minecraft's style. Disable the gradient, remove the edges, and customize it in any way you wish. More features to come soon!**
